improvements:

should set genome length beforehand
- use a ptr instead of a fixed size
  - duplicate bvecomes more complex, less memory efficenty
- use a fixed size, with a limit
  - carry a data meneber who stores the gene length


could speed up alot by having locations be stored in the eviroment as indexs to the creature rather than each creature knowing its own locationb

look at how brains are wired
given a set of neurons, we define connections rather than everything

makes it simpler
