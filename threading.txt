to make this work, i need to be really explicit about the threading. (no forall).

rather than trying to lock different cells and do it in an unstructured way, just structure the algo such that it cannot occur

take a field (x and o represent 3x3 blocks of creatures)

xoxoxoxo
oxoxoxox
xoxoxoxo
oxoxoxox

first pass process all the x's, then process all o's. on next tick, first prprocess o then process x.
only thread safe if appendix A holds true, and since we alternate should be fair

Appendix A:
creature fov

s can be seen

 s
sCs
 s
 sss
sssss
ssCss
sssss
 sss

if they cant see the corners, solves the checkerboard problem for threading
